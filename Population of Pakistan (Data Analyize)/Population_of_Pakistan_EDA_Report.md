# Population of Pakistan: EDA & Visualization Report

---

## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the population of Pakistan, based on the dataset `sub_division_population_of_pakistan.csv`. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about population distribution, urbanization, density, and trends across provinces, districts, and sub-divisions. Visualizations are used throughout to enhance understanding and communicate findings effectively.

## 1. Dataset Overview
- **Source:** `sub_division_population_of_pakistan.csv`
- **Features:** Province, District, Sub-Division, Rural/Urban Population, Area, Population Density
- **Initial Steps:**
  - Loaded the dataset and displayed its structure
  - Standardized column names
  - Checked for missing values and duplicates
  - Handled missing values and removed duplicates

## 5. Data Visualizations

### 5.1 Bar Chart: Total Population by Province
- Each province is represented in a distinct color for clarity
- Punjab and Sindh are the most populous provinces

### 5.2 Horizontal Bar Chart: Top 10 Most Populated Sub-Divisions
- Highlights the sub-divisions with the highest populations
- Lahore and Karachi sub-divisions lead

### 5.3 Pie Chart: Top 5 Provinces by Population
- Shows the population share of the five largest provinces
- Punjab dominates the population share

### 5.4 Heatmap: Correlations Between Numeric Features
- Reveals strong correlations between total, rural, and urban populations
- Moderate correlation with area and population density

### 5.5 Violin Plot: Population Density by Province
- Visualizes the distribution and variation in population density
- Punjab has the highest density, Balochistan the lowest

## 6. Key Insights & Summary

- **Most Populated Province:** Punjab
- **Least Populated Province:** Balochistan
- **Most Populated Sub-Divisions:** Concentrated in Punjab and Sindh
- **Least Populated Sub-Divisions:** Mostly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
- **Rural vs Urban Trends:** Punjab and Sindh have significant urban populations; Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are predominantly rural
- **Population Density:** Punjab highest, Balochistan lowest
- **Outliers & Distribution:** Notable outliers in both rural and urban populations
- **Correlations:** Strong relationships between population features

**Summary:**

The population of Pakistan is highly unevenly distributed, with Punjab and Sindh being the most populous and urbanized provinces. Balochistan, despite its size, remains sparsely populated. There are significant disparities in population density and urbanization across provinces and sub-divisions. These insights can inform policy decisions, resource allocation, and future urban planning initiatives.

## 7. Exported Results
- The cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_sub_division_population.csv`
- All visualizations were exported to the `output/visualizations/` directory

---

## 8. Recommendations
- Focus on urban planning and infrastructure in high-density regions
- Address disparities in resource allocation for less populated provinces
- Further analysis can be performed on migration, age distribution, and economic factors
