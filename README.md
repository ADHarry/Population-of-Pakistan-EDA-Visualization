# Population-of-Pakistan-EDA-Visualization
A comprehensive EDA of Pakistan's population using sub_division_population_of_pakistan.csv, exploring distribution, urbanization, density, and trends across provinces, districts, and sub-divisions, with visualizations to highlight key insights and patterns.

## Insights & Summary


Based on the exploratory data analysis and visualizations, the following key insights were derived:

- **Most Populated Province:** Punjab has the highest total population among all provinces, as shown in the bar and pie charts.
- **Least Populated Province:** Balochistan has the lowest total population, despite being the largest by area.
- **Most Populated Sub-Divisions:** The top 10 most populated sub-divisions are concentrated in Punjab and Sindh, with Lahore and Karachi sub-divisions leading.
- **Least Populated Sub-Divisions:** The least populated sub-divisions are mostly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as seen in the horizontal bar chart.
- **Rural vs Urban Trends:** Punjab and Sindh have significant urban populations, while Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain predominantly rural.
- **Population Density:** Punjab has the highest population density, while Balochistan has the lowest. The violin plot highlights the wide variation in density across provinces.
- **Outliers & Distribution:** Boxplots and histograms reveal outliers in both rural and urban populations, with some sub-divisions having exceptionally high or low populations.
- **Correlations:** The heatmap shows strong correlations between total, rural, and urban populations, and a moderate correlation with area and population density.


**Summary:**

The population of Pakistan is highly unevenly distributed, with Punjab and Sindh being the most populous and urbanized provinces. Balochistan, despite its size, remains sparsely populated. There are significant disparities in population density and urbanization across provinces and sub-divisions. These insights can inform policy decisions, resource allocation, and future urban planning initiatives.
